# What You'll Learn section:


✅ Basic Git Commands

This section introduces the foundational Git commands every developer should know. You’ll learn how to initialize a repository with git init, check the status of your files using git status, stage changes with git add, and record those changes using git commit. These commands are the building blocks of working with Git effectively.

✅ How to Create Repositories

You'll discover how to create a local Git repository on your machine and how to link it to a remote repository on GitHub. This includes setting up a new repository using GitHub’s interface, and connecting it to your project with git remote add origin.

✅ Committing, Pushing, and Pulling

Learn how to manage your project history and sync changes across your local and remote repositories. You'll understand how to save your work using commits, upload your changes to GitHub with git push, and download updates made by others using git pull.

✅ Branching and Merging

Explore how branching allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. You’ll also learn how to bring those changes back together using git merge, ensuring a smooth and organized workflow.

✅ Collaboration via Pull Requests

Understand how GitHub enables collaborative development through pull requests. You’ll see how to propose changes, review code, discuss improvements with teammates, and merge updates into the main project — all in a structured and trackable way.
